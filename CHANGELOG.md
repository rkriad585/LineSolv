# Changelog

## [0.14.0] — 2026-07-14

### Added
- **Full-window opacity/transparency** — window opacity now applies to the entire app window including body, panels, and all surfaces. Default opacity changed to 95%.
- **Real-time settings** — all settings (theme, font, opacity, toggles) apply instantly on change. No Save button required. Changes auto-persist to `config.toml` with debounced writes.
- **Line numbers toggle** — new setting in General > Behavior to show/hide line number gutter (default: on).
- **Reset to Defaults** — new button in settings header replaces the old Save button. Resets all settings to factory defaults with one click.
- **Opacity slider** — adjustable window transparency from 30% to 100% in General > Appearance section.
- **Autocomplete toggle** — enable/disable keyword autocomplete popup from General > Calculator section.
- **Animations toggle** — enable/disable CSS animations and transitions from General > Appearance section.
- **Toast toggle** — enable/disable toast notifications from General > Behavior section.

### Changed
- **SettingsModal** — removed Save button; all controls now call `settingsStore.update()` + `settingsStore.scheduleSave()` on every change for instant apply.
- **SettingsStore** — added `scheduleSave()` method with 300ms debounce for automatic persistence.
- **applySurfaceOpacity()** — now sets `document.body.style.background` directly with rgba for full-window translucency, in addition to CSS variable overrides.
- **Default opacity** — changed from 1.0 (fully opaque) to 0.95 (95% translucent).
- **CalculatorInput** — added `setLineNumbersVisible()` method to show/hide gutter dynamically.
- **SettingsData** — expanded with `opacity`, `line_numbers_enabled`, `autocomplete_enabled`, `animations_enabled`, `toast_enabled` fields.
- **CSS** — `body { background: transparent }` moved from `var(--surface)` to support JS-controlled translucent backgrounds.

## [0.13.0] — 2026-07-14

### Added
- **Keyword autocompletion** — autocomplete popup appears as you type in the calculator input, showing all 236+ builtin functions, constants, and units with prefix matching, category badges, and descriptions.
- **Keyboard navigation** — Arrow Up/Down to navigate, Enter/Tab to select, Escape to dismiss.
- **Dynamic keyword sync** — user-defined variables and plugin functions are included in autocomplete results and refresh automatically after evaluation or plugin changes.
- **Backend keyword endpoint** — `GetAutocompleteKeywords()` Wails binding returns all autocomplete candidates from the engine.

### Changed
- **CalculatorInput** — added `getCursorWord()`, `getCursorPixelPos()`, `replaceWord()` methods for autocomplete integration.
- **AutocompletePopup component** — new overlay popup positioned at cursor with themed styling, category badges, and match highlighting.
- **PluginPanel** — added `onPluginsChanged` callback to trigger keyword refresh after plugin operations.

## [0.12.96] — 2026-07-13

### Fixed
- **Go lint compliance** — resolved all golangci-lint issues (errcheck, gosec, staticcheck).
- **Unused code removed** — `operatorSym`, `aCouplePattern/aDozenPattern/aScorePattern`, `peek()`.
- **File permissions hardened** — `0644`→`0600` for config/state files, `0755`→`0700` for directories.
- **Weak PRNG migration** — `math/rand` → `math/rand/v2` in `fancyname.go`.
- **Lint config** — added `frontend/node_modules` exclude to `.golangci.yml`.
- **Notes panel search input** — search input now shows when panel opens with 1+ notes (was requiring >1).
- **ESLint config** — created flat config for ESLint v9, fixed all lint warnings.

## [0.12.13] — 2026-07-12

### Fixed
- **Self-update v-prefix** — `SetVersion()` now strips the `v` prefix from ldflags input, fixing "Invalid character(s) found in major number" error.
- **Submenu positioning** — Switch Note and Export submenus now measure layout after a `requestAnimationFrame`, preventing off-screen rendering.
- **Export cancel toast** — cancelling save dialog no longer shows false "Note exported" success toast.

### Changed
- **Context menu Panels submenu** — Open Docs, Open Plugins, Open Settings collapsed into a single "Panels" submenu.

## [0.11.17] — 2026-07-11

### Added
- **Docs search** — search input in Documentation sidebar filters tabs by name in real time.
- **Privacy Policy** — new `docs/privacy-policy.md` covering data collection, local storage, network activity, and user rights. Linked from Settings → About tab.

### Fixed
- **Context menu submenus clipped** — Switch Note and Export submenus were invisible due to `overflow-y: auto` on the main menu implicitly setting `overflow-x: auto` (CSS spec), clipping absolutely-positioned submenus. Submenus now render directly on `document.body` with `position: fixed`.
- **Export false success toast** — cancelling the save dialog showed "Note exported". Now checks the backend return value before showing the toast.
- **Docs text selection** — added `user-select: text` directly to content element inline style to override parent's `select-none` class.
- **Context menu positioning** — rewrote `show()` to measure menu first, then calculate optimal position with viewport clamping. Only flips upward when there's truly no room below.
- **Context menu responsive** — added `max-height: calc(100vh - 16px)` with `overflow-y: auto` on both main menu and submenus.
- **Submenu positioning** — submenus now use viewport-relative coordinates calculated from trigger element's bounding rect, with proper boundary clamping.
- **Cut/Copy/Paste** — replaced deprecated `document.execCommand()` with `navigator.clipboard` API and `setRangeText()` for reliable clipboard operations in Wails WebView.
- **About LineSolv tab** — now opens Settings directly to the About tab instead of General.
- **NSIS installer** — added NSIS to PATH after choco install; conditional checksum generation for missing installer.
- **CI Node compatibility** — added `ACTIONS_ALLOW_USE_UNSECURE_NODE_VERSION: true` env var.
- **CI Go version** — bumped release workflow Go from 1.23 to 1.24.

### Changed
- **Context menu icons** — replaced all emoji icons with Lucide-style inline SVGs matching the project's design system.
- **Context menu hover** — removed redundant JS hover handlers, relying on CSS `:hover` rule.

## [0.10.16] — 2026-07-11

### Added
- **Auto-update** — app now queries GitHub Releases, downloads the matching platform binary, and restarts with the new version. Settings modal shows live progress bar.
- **Right-click context menu** — textarea context menu with Cut/Copy/Paste/Select All, separator support, and keyboard shortcuts displayed per-platform.
- **Plus button in title bar** — "+" icon button for quick new note creation.
- **Test coverage reporting** — `npm run test:coverage` + Go `coverprofile` in CI, artifacts uploaded for 14 days.
- **CI coverage artifacts** — frontend lcov/json-summary and backend coverage.out uploaded per-platform.
- **Dockerfile** — Ubuntu 24.04 containerized build with Go 1.24, Node 20, Wails v2.12.0, WebKit/GTK deps.
- **.dockerignore** — excludes build artifacts, node_modules, .git, coverage.
- **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** — Contributor Covenant v2.1, linked from README and CONTRIBUTING.
- **ACCESSIBILITY.md** — WCAG 2.1 AA target, keyboard nav, screen reader matrix, known limitations.
- **pprof profiling** — `app/pprof_dev.go` auto-starts on `localhost:6060` in dev builds; no-op in production.
- **Release workflow raw binaries** — each platform now uploads raw binary + SHA256SUMS for self-update verification.

### Changed
- **Self-update rewritten** — replaced browser "Check for Updates" link with real in-app auto-update using `rhysd/go-github-selfupdate`.
- **CI Go version bumped** to 1.24.
- **`appVersion` changed from `const` to `var`** — set via `SetVersion()` at startup, still overridable via ldflags.

### Fixed
- **Context menu disappearing immediately** — added `e.stopPropagation()` to textarea's `contextmenu` handler to prevent the global close listener from firing.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-07-10

### Added
- **Comprehensive doc examples test** — `TestDocExamples_UserReportedPatterns` covers 13 real-world query patterns (comparisons, purchase math, geometry, freelance, discount)
- **`docs/examples.txt`** — exhaustive list of all supported query examples organized by category

### Fixed
- **Undo/Redo redo stack corruption** — `pushSnapshot()` was clearing the redo stack during programmatic `input` events triggered by `undo()`/`redo()`, making Ctrl+Y silently fail. Added `programmaticChange` flag to preserve the redo stack.
- **File drop UI crash** — dropping a file onto the window caused the WebView to navigate away from the app (black screen). Set `DisableWebViewDrop: true` in Wails config.
- **`discountOnItemPattern`** — added `.*?` to skip intervening words between item name and percentage (e.g. `That $200 jacket I've been eyeing is 25% off`)
- **`purchasePattern`** — made `added on top` optional after `sales tax` (e.g. `6% sales tax. What's the final price?`)
- **`salesTaxIncomePattern`** — changed `[Ww]hat` prefix to `(?i)what` for case-insensitive matching in phrases like `What did I earn?`
- **Date extraction with "for now"** — `timeframePattern` changed from `\s+for\s+now` to `\s+for\b` to prevent greedy match eating trailing text (e.g. `no discounts or tax for now`)

### Removed
- **Drag-and-drop note reordering** — HTML5 Drag-and-Drop API is broken in Wails v2 WebView (`dragover` never fires). Mouse-based replacement could not match the expected UX. Removed entirely. Notes can still be managed via sort button (name/created/updated), rename, create, and delete.

## [0.8.0] — 2026-07-10

### Added
- **Purchase math patterns** — `5 items at $20 each`, `3 items at $10 each with a 15% discount and 8% sales tax`
- **`prefers-reduced-motion` support** — disables all animations for accessibility
- **Focus-visible ring styles** — keyboard navigation outlines all interactive elements in theme accent color
- **Input size limit** — 10,000 character `maxLength` enforced on the textarea (defense in depth alongside Go backend limit)
- **Frontend unit tests** — 13 tests for `CalculatorStore`, 12 tests for `format` utility (29 total across 3 test files)
- **Documentation updates** — architecture.md, frontend.md, api-reference.md, user-guide, README updated to reflect all Phase 2/3/4 features

### Fixed
- **Currency cross-rate conversion** — `$100 + €20` now returns `120` (strips symbols) when no `in`/`to`/`as` keyword is present, instead of converting EUR→USD

### Changed
- Documentation in PLAN.md reconciled — gutter DOM thrashing item (already fixed in Phase 4) marked completed
- All docs now accurately reflect the actual state of all implemented features

## [0.7.0] — 2026-07-08

### Added
- **Step-by-step evaluation** — view intermediate computation steps (naturalize, parse-tree reductions) via StepsPanel toggle (⌘S)

### Changed
- Parser instrumented to collect evaluation steps at every operation level
- Notes DB schema: added `position INTEGER` column with `ALTER TABLE` migration; `GetAllNotes` orders by position
- Backend dependencies: added `github.com/jung-kurt/gofpdf/v2` for PDF generation
- Frontend dependencies: added `chart.js` for function plotting

## [0.6.1] — 2026-07-08

### Fixed
- Window dragging in title bar: moved `--wails-draggable:drag` from inner `dragRegion` to the `<header>` element and added `--wails-draggable:no-drag` to all buttons and their container divs, matching the Wails v2 official pattern for frameless windows

## [0.6.0] — 2026-07-07

### Added
- Print button in title bar (printer SVG icon, tooltip "Print (⌘P)")
- `Ctrl/Cmd+P` keyboard shortcut to print the current note

- Expanded context references: `previous`, `last`, `prior`, `prev` (standalone and with `result`/`answer`)
- Expanded comparison phrases: `half as much as`, `quarter as much as`, `how many X in Y`
- Expanded percentage patterns: `pct` / `p.c.` abbreviations, `what percent of Y is X`, `X out of Y as a percentage`, `X plus Y% tip/tax`, `X minus/after Y% discount`
- Expanded date patterns: `in N days/weeks`, `what is the date in N days`, `N days before/after today`, `next/last/this Mon/Tue/Wed...`
- 33 new test cases across all new pattern categories (82 total, up from 49)
